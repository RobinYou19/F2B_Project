xaal.ipx800
===========
This package contains a xAAL gateway for IPX-800 Ethernet Control System.


Install
=======
You can use both pip, with pip install xaal.ipx800 or setup.py

You can test the package with :
python setup.py develop (or install) --user

To run the gateway:
- edit your config file (~/.xaal/xaal.ipx800.ini) 
- launch python -m xaal.ipx800


TODO
====
Due to time constraint, only channel outputs (relays) are
supported right now. You can add easily analog or digital
inputs, everything is ready.

Perhaps, in future.
